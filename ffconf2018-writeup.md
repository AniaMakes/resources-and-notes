# FFConf - Brighton - 9 Nov 2018

Hello! This is my write-up of the FFConf2018. As with any conference, the videos will eventually be available on-line to listen in detail. The points made here are collated from my notes and my tweets from the day.

### "Mentoring: being the help you wish you'd had" [Jo Franchetti](https://twitter.com/ThisIsJoFrank)

Jo has put together a comprehensive talk about mentoring - what it can be, what it should be, and what it must not be. 

She made it clear that anyone can be a mentor - even as "juniors", we have more knowledge on the subject than total newcomers. This mirrors my experience with tutoring at codebar. I started doing that about 4 weeks into my coding bootcamp course. In practice, the knowledge I had was covered by FreeCodeCamp's "Basic JavaScript" Section. But even then, I was able to help newcomers with their `Hello World`s. 

An anecdote she presented made it clear that although the mentor-mentee relationship seems to be one directional (the mentor supports the mentee), oftentimes the mentor learns too. A feature a mentee wants to implement might seem daft - a rosette that follows the user up and down the page and is a link to external website - why would you want the user to navigate away? Well, if the user is viewing the website surrepticiously, being able to quickly navigate to a site like news or YouTube provides a peace of mind. 

Furthermore, mentoring provides opportunity for the mentor to practice patience, expressing themselves and their ideas clearly, and to listen. Mentees don't necessarily need to hear about their mentor's experiences, they need the space and the opportunity to express themselves.

As a mentor you will become your mentees personal cheerleader - celebrate their achievements, acknowledge their successes, and provide validation when needed. 

Key points to remember when arranging mentoring:
1. Set expectations
2. Set goals
    Set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound) goals.
3. Schedule and review
    How often and how (in person / digital). Don't be afraid to change if it's not working!
4. Listen
    Ask leading / open questions.
    Regular feedback (forms?) to allow to track progress and needs
    Concrit feedback
5. Enable 
    Ask leading / open questions
    Dig deeper
    Offer sponsorship / introductions
