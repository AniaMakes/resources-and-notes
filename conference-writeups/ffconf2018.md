# FFConf - Brighton - 9 Nov 2018

Hello! This is my write-up of the FFConf2018. As with any conference, the videos will eventually be available on-line to listen in detail. The points made here are collated from my notes and my tweets from the day. As with any conference, there are subjects that I made more notes on that the others, but that's not to say that note-worthy talks were better. It just means that there were specific issues I'm more likely to take notes on, and some talks had demos - and it's kinda hard to make notes on those!

The conference was fabulous: the talks were well curated; the crowd was friendly and I felt like I really belonged; the crowd felt like a giant family rather than just a bunch of bodies attending a conference; it had newcomers to tech, and those who have been around for years; I met people who knew and met people who I'd like to meet again; the after party had board games to help with socialising... Let's just say I already have tickets for next year's edition. It's that good. Totally worth the last minute arrangemnts (bought Friday ticket on Wednesday). Worth it if you're a 2-3 hour flight away. And just-about worth it to fly in from another continent, in my opinion.

## "Mentoring: being the help you wish you'd had" [Jo Franchetti](https://twitter.com/ThisIsJoFrank)
Check out [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12Nz165q_-x7d8-K6uy5p935JCIGekL1Q1IM8HWxents/edit#slide=id.g24ec50767a_0_12).

Jo has put together a comprehensive talk about mentoring - what it can be, what it should be, and what it must not be. 

She made it clear that anyone can be a mentor - even as "juniors", we have more knowledge on the subject than total newcomers. This mirrors my experience with tutoring at codebar. I started doing that about 4 weeks into my coding bootcamp course. In practice, the knowledge I had was covered by FreeCodeCamp's "Basic JavaScript" Section. But even then, I was able to help newcomers with their `Hello World`s. 

An anecdote she presented made it clear that although the mentor-mentee relationship seems to be one directional (the mentor supports the mentee), oftentimes the mentor learns too. A feature a mentee wants to implement might seem daft - a rosette that follows the user up and down the page and is a link to external website - why would you want the user to navigate away? Well, if the user is viewing the website surrepticiously, being able to quickly navigate to a site like news or YouTube provides a peace of mind. 

Furthermore, mentoring provides opportunity for the mentor to practice patience, expressing themselves and their ideas clearly, and to listen. Mentees don't necessarily need to hear about their mentor's experiences, they need the space and the opportunity to express themselves.

As a mentor you will become your mentees personal cheerleader - celebrate their achievements, acknowledge their successes, and provide validation when needed. 

Key points to remember when arranging mentoring:
1. Set expectations
2. Set goals
    Set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound) goals.
3. Schedule and review
    How often and how (in person / digital). Don't be afraid to change if it's not working!
4. Listen
    Ask leading / open questions.
    Regular feedback (forms?) to allow to track progress and needs
    Concrit feedback
5. Enable 
    Ask leading / open questions
    Dig deeper
    Offer sponsorship / introductions

## "The future of javascript & machine learning" [Eleanor Haproff](https://twitter.com/EleanorHaproff)

I need to admit, machine learning is one of those subjects that I find super fascinating, and at the same time I'm totally overwhelmed by its complexity to have a go at it. 

The talk certainly helped me to figure out the distinction between Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally, a TL;DR definitions for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ffconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ffconf</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorHaproff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EleanorHaproff</a>

I also learned that isolated data isn't worth much - it takes (usually a human) to train the neural network so that it knows what's important and what is its importance "weight". Neural networks were compared to our brains; after all, that's what they are simulating. The difference is that when axons (nerve cells) get triggered thanks to neurotransmitters it's all or nothing reaction, whereas in neural networks there will always be a reaction, it will just carry different weight overall. 

Eleanor provided a couple of really cool demo videos. The first one was training the computer to recognise simple head movement in front of the camera ( on the right / on the left / on the top / on the bottom), and then using those programmed head movements to play Pacman. The second one had a camera tracking user's body movement, and for each pose displaying image from its database where the pose on the image matched the user's pose. 

The main tool for this job is TensorFlow, which now exists in the form of a JS library. 

There are a number of meetups in London on the subject. The two I know of are [TensorFlow](https://www.meetup.com/London-TensorFlow-Meetup/) and [AI JavaScript London](https://www.meetup.com/AI-JavaScript-London/)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I loved <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorHaproff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EleanorHaproff</a>’s talk at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ffconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ffconf</a> today about the future of Javascript and machine learning.

## "Practical web animation" [Lisi Linhart](https://twitter.com/lisi_linhart)
You can [access the slides here](https://noti.st/lisi/whJN75/practical-web-animation).

Unsurprisingly, web animations is another one of the subjects / skill-sets that look super cool, but I'm not sure where to start!

Lisi's talk explained how animations can be done and what are the benefits of each approach. 

**My main take-away point were:**

Make animations for the benefit of the user, to help the user as much as possible within constraints of the browsers. Animations should be, first and foremost, helpful. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are four types of animation a browser can do cheaply: translate, transform, rotate, opacity. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ffconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ffconf</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/lisi_linhart?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@lisi_linhart</a></p>&mdash; Ania (@AniaMakes) <a href="https://twitter.com/AniaMakes/status/1060864052409307136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

## "Is it possible to build a truly diverse community?" [Jenny Wong](https://twitter.com/miss_jwo)
Check out the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/missjwo/is-it-possible-to-build-a-truly-diverse-community)

Oh, what a ride! Jenny's talk was full of excellent hints and tips when it comes to running an event and making sure all who attend have a good and stress-free time. I think the TL;DR in my tweet below sums it up quite well. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Aim for inclusivity, not for diversity when organising events. Ask yourself if a potential feature makes your event more - or less - inclusive. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ffconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ffconf</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/miss_jwo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@miss_jwo</a></p>&mdash; Ania (@AniaMakes) <a href="https://twitter.com/AniaMakes/status/1060882349938954240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

You might wonder what the difference is. Well, as far as I understand it, you can't have diverstity without ensuring that everyone feels welcome and is able to enjoy the conference. This includes people who have a bad day, are not neurotypical, have disabilities, are or need carers, or are parents - this is by no means a full list. There are things you can do which are free that makes a big difference, such as making sure that your content is worded in a friendly tone of voice and is gender neutral. Make sure you proof-read your materials. Other things, such as childcare, can cost signigicant amounts of money. But by offering that, you enable parents to attend. 

It does help if you have a motely organising committee - if everyone aims to show what they'd like to see, hopefully your event will become more inclusive for everyone. Not everything is easy. Some things depend on the venue, and sometimes there aren't that many options, so one needs to ops out for the lesser evil. 

Gosh, it's hard to put everything into prose, so here's the list from my notes; nota bene, many more points are covered by slides.

**Written content**
- gender neutral
- right tone of voice
- proof read

**Child care**
- find professionals!
- vet them
- meet in person
- build trust - using the same crèche team every year means parents of prospective users can see the team in action 

**venue**
- wheelchair friendly - wide aisles, lifts that work
- T-loops - make sure they work!
- de-gendered toilets - make sure you check with the venue managers first. Provide comfort baskets in all bathrooms.
- Special rooms - on top of the talk & workshop rooms and cafeteria - multi-faith room; lactation room; quiet room; speakers' room; volunteers' room; work room; break-out spaces; overflow areas

**Signage: allow people to help themselves**
- bunting or other ceiling / wall decorations to show what areas are part of the conference
- more signs than you think
- bigger signs than you think
- reading friendly font
- BRANDED signs
- put signs above head height (so that even shorter people can see and read them)
- putting up signs takes more time than you realise
- have plenty of blank branded sheets and a fat-tip marker to make signs as needed
- volunteer T-shirts / sashes / something that makes them easily distinguishable as volunteers

**General organisation**
- allow turn-over times between sessions long enough so that the slowest user can get between the two furthest room and get in a bathroom break without needing to rush. 
- offer back-of-the-house lunch (before the attendee lunch) for stall holders & volunteers so they are ready to look after the crowds
- have different coloured lanyards to distinguish between happy to be photographed / ask before taking photo / don't take photos
- live captioning is not just for hard of hearing! It helps to make sense of people's accents, and can act as a sanity check ("did they really just say that?!")
- if possible, add a live captioning screen for the speaker to see - even if it's just so that they can see the questions asked
- offer buddy system between speakers, or independent mentors, to help speakers to prepare
- on the ticket page ask for things like: crèche needs, dietary requirements, if they need carer support (and offer free or reduced fee carer tickets), preferred pronouns
- have at least one dedicated volunteer to look after speakers
- try to run a non-alcohol centric event (alcohol at the bottom of the menu)
- make posters with food and drink menus and have them set up so people can see what's on offer before they need to order - put them on the website, if possible
- provide information about budget breakdown - either in booklets, or on-line. 
- ask for help if you need it. Monetary or otherwise

The list is excellent and by no means exclusive. Every single person can probably think of something that would make that event they attended recently a bit better. My personal additions to the list: 
* if you have numbered tables and named seating, sure have one pretty list to display. However, please, please have many lists available ordered by NAME alphabetically instead of the table number. Everyone knows roughtly where to find their name in the alphabetical list, so people find their name much quicker. It also avoids the anxiety of looking at the pretty list thinking "I can't see my name, why can't I see my name...". 
* if the dress code is not casual, please make it clear what it **is** and ideally provide a couple of photos to show what you mean. I suck at fashion but I don't want to stand out like a sore thumb.

Last thing - Jenny's talk concentrated on conferences, but it does apply to **any** event. When my nesting partner and I got married, we threw a party at a local village hall. We had a quiet room (some guests were more sensitive to noise, and there were babies). We has alphabetical seating list. In the RSVP forms we asked everyone about their dietary requirements, if there are any relevant mobility issues we needed to know of, and if they would be able to provide lifts to and from the venue for those without cars. We had clear dress code ("We'll wear jeans and a nice shirt. If your child wants to dress up in a costume, we're chill with that; we know how picky kids can be.")

## "Back to the future of js: the next features and amazing proposals" [Willian Martins](https://twitter.com/wmsbill)

I'm not going to pretend I undestood all of the talk. It had nuances that went over my head. There was talk about `this` and binding features. There were a fair few mentions of currying; I somehow doubt it has anything to do with Indian food. 

One point that I **did** understand:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JSNext: pipeline operator to replace chaining. Still work in progress, especially when it comes to handling `await`, but exciting nevertheless. <a href="https://twitter.com/wmsbill?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@wmsbill</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ffconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ffconf</a></p>&mdash; Ania (@AniaMakes) <a href="https://twitter.com/AniaMakes/status/1060910919616815106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

This pipeline operator will work the way terminal's `|` works and will replace dot-chaining. The proposed symbol for the pipe operator is `|>`. For those who are not familiar with `|`, it first does the action before the symbol, takes the result, and passes it in as a variable to the action after the symbol.

## "Dear developer, the web isn't about you" [Charlie Owen](https://twitter.com/sonniesedge)
Charlie provided not only slides, but made an article - [check it out!](https://www.sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer)

This is difficult subject to talk about and kudo's to Charlie for having not only a stab at it, but a really, really well executed stab! The gist of the talk was that we, as developers, have access to all sorts of exciting toys and tools - animations, React, JavaScript effects and logic. We also need to implement the things that our bosses want - the GDPR popup, the newsletter subscription popup, etc. But put together, all these things make our websites unwieldy for a huge number of users. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Super important point, often overlooked: many websites are heavy, and rely on content served by JavaScript. This is actually horribly exclusive for users with slow connection speeds (developing world, but also rural areas) and low-spec devices. <a href="https://twitter.com/sonniesedge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sonniesedge</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ffconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ffconf</a></p>&mdash; Ania (@AniaMakes) <a href="https://twitter.com/AniaMakes/status/1060918590323544065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

As creators of content, we can't start with "I know this fancy technology, I'll use it in my website / app". We have responsibility to start with "Let's implement the content in the simplest fashion and go from there". You may be familiar with this The Oatmeal comic : [Restaurant Website](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/restaurant_website).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Simple solutions are the most robust ones. Get those working first. Only then add features, gradually, layer by layer, starting with basic CSS, and only adding JavaScript at the end. <a href="https://twitter.com/sonniesedge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sonniesedge</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ffconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ffconf</a></p>&mdash; Ania (@AniaMakes) <a href="https://twitter.com/AniaMakes/status/1060922218568474624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

Charlie mentioned that her employer, Springer Nature, has come up  with ["Springer Nature Frontend Playbook"](https://github.com/springernature/frontend-playbook) that outlines the process of web and app development that shall be used across the organisation. 

What is worth noting is that what is an edge case for the developer can be the main experience for the user. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Edge cases happen when people are stressed and need your app to just fucking work. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">People are not edge cases 🙌♥️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ffconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ffconf</a></p>&mdash; Seren Davies (@ninjanails) <a href="https://twitter.com/ninjanails/status/1060921675544453120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

I can't locate it now, but there was a tweet / image doing rounds of a boarding pass. The app (for whatever reason) didn't work. It reads something like this:
<blockquote>
This is your ticket for ${time} ${date} flight to ${location}.
</blockquote>
That's not exactly helpful, is it?

Charlie had two images in her talk. The first one a pyramid with three components: HTML as the base part, CSS as the middle part, and JS as the tip part. This represents a well made website. The second image has the JS tip as the bottom most part and the two other components balanced precariously on top. This is what devs should avoid, but inevitably end up doing. 

Be a good dev. Use JavaScript as icing in the cake. Cake should still be cake without the icing. Too much icing makes the cake way too sweet and actually not that tasty. If you want to add icing, don't over-do it.

## "Using a modern web to recreate 1980s horribly slow & loud loading screens" [Remy Sharp](https://twitter.com/rem)

Kudos to Remy for stepping in when the original speaker needed to withdraw!

This wasn't really a talk, more like a demo of the "look at the cool stuff I can do with JavaScript just because I want to" flavour. And it's definitely worth watching in person - I first watched it as a video from JSConf-EU-2018 and I didn't find it super exciting, but in watching it being delivered sitting in the same room was so much fun! 

Content wise - the name says it all!

## "Weird web & curious creation" [Tim Holman](https://twitter.com/twholman)

Half talk, half demo, also of the "look at the cool stuff I can do with JavaScript just because I want to" flavour. 

Tim has shown the audience a number of things he built just because he had an idea and wanted to make it happen. Those things include:
* [console.frog](http://tholman.com/console-dot-frog/) - why have a boring console.log when you can have a frog ASCII art with a speech bubble?
* [obnoxious.css](http://tholman.com/post/obnoxious-css/) - you probably encountered animate.css. Obnoxious.css is, well, significantly more obnoxious. 
* [elevator.js](http://tholman.com/post/elevator-js/) - now your "take me to the top" action is accompanied with lovely muzak sounds, just like in a real elevator! Including a lovely bell sound when you reach the top.
* You know that DVD screensaver of the DVD logo bouncing from screen edge to screen edge? Tim made a version where the logo is much more likely to hit a corner! 
* [Buddy](https://github.com/tholman/buddy) - a Chrome plugin that follows the user as they surf the web. Follow the link to watch the demo, but as a sneak preview a warning: Buddy can Rick-Roll you!

Main take-away from Tim's talk:

## Note on mental health
I decided, wherever possible, to end my talks / write-ups with this note. Mental health is important. Depression and anxiety are real. They can suck out the joy of living out of you. There are many other mental health issues, but those are the two that affected me, so I talk about just those two. 

Depression has many symptoms. Many say they lose interest in doing thing they previously loved doing. Getting out of bed can be difficult, standing in the shower might take up all the energy you have for the day. I found that I was always tired; stuck in first gear so to speak. 

Anxiety can be debilitating. It stops you doing stuff you love for irrational reasons. I toyed with the idea of moving away from the town I was living in (and where I had all my support network) to pursue an MSc. Just the idea of the possibility of a chance of moving away triggered an hour long sobbing/crying episode. 

Meds helped. Many mental health issues are simply chemical imbalances in the brain. "Meds are unnatural" approach is bullshit; if you had diabetes, you would not refuse insulin because "it's unnatural". Meds are there to compensate where your body falls short. Your mileage may vary, different meds will have different effect; if an average day was 4/10, Sertraline (first SSRI I tried, stayed on for about 6 months) made it 6/10 and Citalopram (second one, that I stayed on for better part of 2 years) made it 9.5/10 for me. 

I'm no longer on meds. Circumstances in my life changed, I was able to scale back and stop completely. I still sometimes have bad days. I conside myself a [spoonie](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/). I often flop on the sofa at the end of the day unable to do much more than browse the internet aimlessly. 

If you are struggling, don't be afraid to talk. Not everyone might be able to empathise. You might be surprised how many other people face the same difficulties. There are counselling services on-line that you can access for a reasonable price. If you can, talk to your doctor. Figure out what works for you. 

Be honest with yourself; admitting something isn’t right is the hardest step in making it right.
